    <h2 class="eYgaub">I am an American time traveler from 2072, AMA</h2>
    <p>Time travel has always existed. Today, or 54 years ago, I’m telling you to ask me anything you want to know
        about the future. I will answer it honestly, but I cannot reveal my identity due to wanting to avoid criminal
        prosecution for contacting the past.</p>
    <p>Update - February 28, 2018 at 8:26 PM: I have to log off of Reddit to return to the task at hand that I have for
        the government. This was a diversion, and it was only possible because of the complete uncertainty that you
        have. Only I know what will happen, and it would be amazing if I got to read the reactions for when these things
        actually happen. Goodbye, Reddit. I will hopefully be able to log on again soon. Until next time, your favorite
        American time traveler from 2072.</p>

                    battling pneumonia for a few weeks. It's actually quite tragic. North Korea crumbles in early
                    February of 2026, and the Korean Peninsula is finally united. I am 70 years old in 2072. New York
                    City's population is currently 10.2 million (if I'm remembering correctly) which is only because of
                    population control projects that the state of New York conducts. Otherwise, it'd be a lot larger.
                    Nigeria is not a major world power, but Mali, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa become really important
                    in global affairs. I am not making this up. I promise you that I am being honest.</td>

                    faced while pursuing the career of an author, a Matt Kinney who is a producer on a reality show, and
                    a Matt Kinney who holds an executive position at a restaurant chain. Any of those sound like you?
                    Also, the internet is actually really fast and expansive. If you think you have a lot of information
